# PrepFiles2Share

This repository contains scripts that are meant to help you prepare your dataset for public sharing.

Already present:
- Converting DICOMs to Nifti, removing personal header information and defacing (script + notes)
- Compressing files and directories for easier transfer and storage

Soon to come:
- Renaming BrainVision files (including header information) to fit BIDS specification
