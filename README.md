# PrepFiles2Share

This repository contains scripts that are meant to help you prepare your dataset for public sharing.

Already present:
- Converting DICOMs to Nifti, removing personal header information and defacing (script + notes)
- Compressing files and directories for easier transfer and storage
- Renaming BrainVision files (including header information) to be closer to BIDS specification
- Renaming and moving other files (.csv, .EDF, etc...)
